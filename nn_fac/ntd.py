    ======================================
    Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD)
    ======================================

    Factorization of a tensor T in nonnegative matrices,
    linked by a nonnegative core tensor, of dimensions equal to the ranks
    (in general smaller than the tensor).
    See more details about the NTD in [1].

    For example, in the third-order case, resolution of:
        T \approx (W \otimes H \otimes Q) G

    In this example, W, H and Q are the factors, one per mode, and G is the core tensor.
    W is of size T.shape[0] * ranks[0],
    H is of size T.shape[1] * ranks[1],
    Q is of size T.shape[2] * ranks[2],
    G is of size ranks[0] * ranks[1] * ranks[2].

    More precisely, the chosen optimization algorithm is the HALS [2] for the factors,
    which updates each factor columnwise, fixing every other columns,
    and a projected gradient for the core,
    which reduces the memory neccesited to perfome HALS on the core.
    The projected gradient rule is derived by the authors, and doesn't appear in citation for now.

    Tensors are manipulated with the tensorly toolbox [3].

    In tensorly and in our convention, tensors are unfolded and treated as described in [4].

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor: tensorly tensor
        The nonnegative tensor T, to factorize
    ranks: list of integers
        The ranks for each factor of the decomposition
    init: "random" | "tucker" | "custom" |
        - If set to random:
            Initializes with random factors of the correct size.
            The randomization is the uniform distribution in [0,1),
            which is the default from numpy random.
        - If set to tucker:
            Resolve a tucker decomposition of the tensor T (by HOSVD) and
            initializes the factors and the core as this resolution, clipped to be nonnegative.
            The tucker decomposition is performed with tensorly [3].
        - If set to "chromas":
            Resolve a tucker decomposition of the tensor T (by HOSVD) and
            initializes the factors and the core as this resolution, clipped to be nonnegative.
            The tucker decomposition is performed with tensorly [3].
            Contrary to "tucker" init, the first factor will then be set to the 12-size identity matrix,
            because it's a decomposition model specific for modeling music expressed in chromas.
        - If set to custom:
            core_0 and factors_0 (see below) will be used for the initialization
        Default: random
    core_0: None or tensor of nonnegative floats
        A custom initialization of the core, used only in "custom" init mode.
        Default: None
    factors_0: None or list of array of nonnegative floats
        A custom initialization of the factors, used only in "custom" init mode.
        Default: None
    n_iter_max: integer
        The maximal number of iteration before stopping the algorithm
        Default: 100
    tol: float
        Threshold on the improvement in cost function value.
        Between two succesive iterations, if the difference between 
        both cost function values is below this threshold, the algorithm stops.
        Default: 1e-6
    sparsity_coefficients: list of float (as much as the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        The sparsity coefficients on each factor and on the core respectively.
        If set to None or [], the algorithm is computed without sparsity
        Default: []
    fixed_modes: list of integers (between 0 and the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        Has to be set not to update a factor, taken in the order of modes and lastly on the core.
        Default: []
    normalize: list of boolean (as much as the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        Indicates whether the factors need to be normalized or not.
        The normalization is a l_2 normalization on each of the rank components
        (For the factors, each column will be normalized, ie each atom of the dimension of the current rank).
        Default: []
    mode_core_norm: integer or None
        The mode on which normalize the core, or None if normalization shouldn't be enforced.
        Will only be useful if the last element of the previous "normalise" argument is set to True.
        Indexes of the modes start at 0.
        Default: None
    verbose: boolean
        Indicates whether the algorithm prints the successive
        normalized cost function values or not
        Default: False
    return_costs: boolean
        Indicates whether the algorithm should return all normalized cost function 
        values and computation time of each iteration or not
        Default: False
    deterministic:
        Runs the algorithm as a deterministic way, by fixing seed in all possible randomisation,
        and optimization techniques in the NNLS, function of the runtime.
        This is made to enhance reproducible research, and should be set to True for computation of results.

    Returns
    -------
    core: tensorly tensor
        The core tensor linking the factors of the decomposition
    factors: numpy #TODO: For tensorly pulling, replace numpy by backend
        An array containing all the factors computed with the NTD
    cost_fct_vals: list
        A list of the normalized cost function values, for every iteration of the algorithm.
    toc: list, only if return_errors == True
        A list with accumulated time at each iterations

    Example
    -------
    tensor = np.random.rand(80,100,120)

    alpha : positive float
        Ratio between outer computations and inner loops. Typically set to 0.5 or 1.

    =============================================================================
    Nonnegative Tucker Decomposition (NTD) minimizing the $\beta$-divergence loss
    =============================================================================

    Factorization of a tensor T in nonnegative matrices,
    linked by a nonnegative core tensor, of dimensions equal to the ranks
    (in general smaller than the tensor).
    See more details about the NTD in [1].

    For example, in the third-order case, resolution of:
        T \approx (W \otimes H \otimes Q) G

    In this example, W, H and Q are the factors, one per mode, and G is the core tensor.
    W is of size T.shape[0] * ranks[0],
    H is of size T.shape[1] * ranks[1],
    Q is of size T.shape[2] * ranks[2],
    G is of size ranks[0] * ranks[1] * ranks[2].

    In this context, \approx means that the tensor product (W \otimes H \otimes Q) G
    is meant to be as close as possible to T, with respect to some distance or divergence function.
    
    In `ntd_mu`, this divergence is the $\beta$-divergence loss [2].
    This divergence function generalizes some other divergences such as the Euclidean norm,
    the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence.
    
    This approximation is obtained with an optimization algorithm, and more specfically,
    by using the Multiplicative Update as defined for NMF in [3] and redeveloped in [2].
    
    This algorithm will be described in a future publication 
    (TODO: update this comments at submission/publication time.)

    Tensors are manipulated with the tensorly toolbox [4].

    In tensorly and in our convention, tensors are unfolded and treated as described in [5].

    Parameters
    ----------
    tensor: tensorly tensor
        The nonnegative tensor T, to factorize
    ranks: list of integers
        The ranks for each factor of the decomposition
    init: "random" | "tucker" | "custom" |
        - If set to random:
            Initializes with random factors of the correct size.
            The randomization is the uniform distribution in [0,1),
            which is the default from numpy random.
        - If set to tucker:
            Resolve a tucker decomposition of the tensor T (by HOSVD) and
            initializes the factors and the core as this resolution, clipped to be nonnegative.
            The tucker decomposition is performed with tensorly [3].
        - If set to custom:
            core_0 and factors_0 (see below) will be used for the initialization
        Default: random
    core_0: None or tensor of nonnegative floats
        A custom initialization of the core, used only in "custom" init mode.
        Default: None
    factors_0: None or list of array of nonnegative floats
        A custom initialization of the factors, used only in "custom" init mode.
        Default: None
    n_iter_max: integer
        The maximal number of iteration before stopping the algorithm
        Default: 100
    tol: float
        Threshold on the improvement in cost function value.
        Between two succesive iterations, if the difference between 
        both cost function values is below this threshold, the algorithm stops.
        Default: 1e-6
    beta: float
        The beta parameter for the beta-divergence.
        2 - Euclidean norm
        1 - Kullback-Leibler divergence
        0 - Itakura-Saito divergence
    sparsity_coefficients: list of float (as much as the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        The sparsity coefficients on each factor and on the core respectively.
        If set to None or [], the algorithm is computed without sparsity
        Default: []
    fixed_modes: list of integers (between 0 and the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        Has to be set not to update a factor, taken in the order of modes and lastly on the core.
        Default: []
    normalize: list of boolean (as much as the number of modes + 1 for the core)
        Indicates whether the factors need to be normalized or not.
        The normalization is a l_2 normalization on each of the rank components
        (For the factors, each column will be normalized, ie each atom of the dimension of the current rank).
        Default: []
    mode_core_norm: integer or None
        The mode on which normalize the core, or None if normalization shouldn't be enforced.
        Will only be useful if the last element of the previous "normalise" argument is set to True.
        Indexes of the modes start at 0.
        Default: None
    verbose: boolean
        Indicates whether the algorithm prints the successive
        normalized cost function values or not
        Default: False
    return_costs: boolean
        Indicates whether the algorithm should return all normalized cost function 
        values and computation time of each iteration or not
        Default: False
    deterministic:
        Runs the algorithm as a deterministic way, by fixing seed in all possible randomisation,
        and optimization techniques in the NNLS, function of the runtime.
        This is made to enhance reproducible research, and should be set to True for computation of results.

    Returns
    -------
    core: tensorly tensor
        The core tensor linking the factors of the decomposition
    factors: numpy #TODO: For tensorly pulling, replace numpy by backend
        An array containing all the factors computed with the NTD
    cost_fct_vals: list
        A list of the normalized cost function values, for every iteration of the algorithm.
    toc: list, only if return_errors == True
        A list with accumulated time at each iterations

    Example
    -------
    tensor = np.random.rand(80,100,120)
    ranks = [10,20,15]
    core, factors = NTD.ntd(tensor, ranks = ranks, init = "tucker", verbose = True, hals = False,
                            sparsity_coefficients = [None, None, None, None], normalize = [True, True, False, True])
